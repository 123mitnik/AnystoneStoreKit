Version 0.5-preview1 (development)
-----------

The Anystone Store Kit is ready to be used for all store kit operations that you might want to do locally on your device.

It currently has the following functionality:
 - Does not require changing source code to configure products
 - Supports consumable, nonconsumables, and autorenewables
 - Supports consumable families to enable multiple product ids to manipulate the same resource
 - Delegate methods for all of the major changes you might want to be notified about
 - Ability to wipe local data clean (for debug and for dealing with possible corruption)
 - Testing in simulator using the embedded SimStoreKit (not including AutoRenewables)
 - Encrypted family data storage for purchase quantities
