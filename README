It currently has the following functionality:

 - Supports consumable and nonconsumables
 - Supports consumable families to enable multiple product ids to manipulate the same resource
 - Delegate methods for all of the major 
 - Ability to wipe local data clean (for debug and for dealing with possible corruption)
 - Testing in simulator using the embedded SimStoreKit
